/*Dereferencing the void * Pointer:

*(int*)p:
To dereference a void *, you must first cast it to the appropriate type. In this case, (int*)p casts the void * pointer to an int * (pointer to an integer).
Once it's cast to int *, we can safely dereference it using * to access the value it points to.
Since p points to i (which is 10), *(int*)p will yield 10.  */
