#include<stdio.h>

void main() {
    int num, rev = 0, digit;
    
    printf("Enter the number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);  // Corrected to use &num to get the input
    
    while(num > 0) {
        digit = num % 10;  // Extract the last digit
        rev = (rev * 10) + digit;  // Build the reversed number
        num = num / 10;  // Remove the last digit from num
    }
    
    printf("Reversed number: %d", rev);  // Output the reversed number
}


Example:
Input: 1234
Process:
Extract 4 from 1234, reverse becomes 4, and the number becomes 123.
Extract 3 from 123, reverse becomes 43, and the number becomes 12.
Extract 2 from 12, reverse becomes 432, and the number becomes 1.
Extract 1 from 1, reverse becomes 4321, and the number becomes 0.
Output: 4321
